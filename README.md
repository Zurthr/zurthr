## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Zur! (or Zul) and I'm an undergraduate student interested in designing, writing, and unsurprisingly, making games!

## What I'm currently interested in ðŸ«£
- Front-End Development
- UI/UX Development
- Machine Learning
- Game Development (for ages, bro!)

Other than code-related activities, I have tons of experiences in organizations, especially with leading and/or managerial positions.
Wish me luck on landing my dream jobs, y'all! âœ¨
